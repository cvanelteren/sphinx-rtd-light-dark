Read the Docs Minimal Theme
---------------------------

A minimal variant of the [read the docs theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme)
with grayscale styling and optional "dark mode" / "light mode" toggling. This theme
is currently used with the [proplot](https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot.git)
and [climopy](https://github.com/lukelbd/climopy.git) projects.
